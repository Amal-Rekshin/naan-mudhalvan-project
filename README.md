# 🧩 Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to optimize **User, Group, and Role Management** in enterprise systems by integrating **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and **automated Workflows**.  
The goal is to ensure that the right people have the right access at the right time — securely and efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement a structured system for managing users, roles, and groups.  
- Strengthen security using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.  
- Automate approval and assignment processes using **Workflows**.  
- Enhance transparency through activity logs and audit tracking.

## 🧠 Ideation Phase
### 1. Brainstorming – Idea Generation – Prioritization
- Explored challenges in manual access management.  
- Generated ideas such as automated provisioning, centralized user management, and workflow approvals.  
- Prioritized based on feasibility and organizational impact.

### 2. Define Problem Statement
Manual access management leads to inefficiency, errors, and security risks.  
This project solves these issues through a secure, automated, and centralized system for managing access.

### 3. Empathy Map Canvas
| Element | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Says** | “Manual access control takes too much time.” |
